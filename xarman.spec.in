%description
An addictive two player cross between Minesweeper and Dyna Blaster.

The Great War (World War IV) destroyed all life on planet Earth. Two
revival clans got away in large space stations. Now 50 years after,
both clans want to reconquer the Earth. But the ground is covered with
mines. The clans send specially designed cyborgs to conquer
terrain. These cyborgs are equipped with a mine scanner. They always
know how many mines there are in a short radius. And they can find the
mines, but that takes time. The red and the blue team fights to get
the land first. Only one clan can move back to Earth.
